Even Fibonacci numbers:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


POINT:

We need the fibonacci sol for this, and it can be done using 2 ways:
1) Naive sol is to use recursion which gives the sequence.
 TC: O(2^n)

2) Use DP to get the sequence and then apply answer logic
 TC: O(n)
 SC: O(n)
