Multiples of 3 and 5


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


POINT:

1) solution 1 is use the naive approach, and keep dividing 1000 by 3,5,15 and keep adding the relevant counts till 1000
 is reached.
 TC: O(n)

2) solution 2 is to use the math of Arithmetic Progression formula to find the sum of sequences for 3,5, and 15 and
 apply the logic.

 for a given arithmetic progression, a0, a1, a2, a3,.... an, where
 a0 - first term
 an - last term
 d - common difference
 n - number of terms

 the sum of series is given by:
 S = (n/2)*[2*a0 + (n-1)*d]

 TC: O(1)
